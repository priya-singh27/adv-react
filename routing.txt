(Q) How can we use 'react-router-dom' for routing purpose?

<BrowserRouter> (The Manager) ➡️

    Creates and manages the history object 

    Provides routing context (like location, navigate) to all child components via React Context.

    Listens to URL changes (e.g., back/forward button clicks) and updates the location.

<Routes> (The Matcher) ➡️

    Watches the location.pathname (from context).

    Iterates through its child <Route> components to find the first matching path.

(2)What is a location object?
location object provides information about URL and also provides some APIs to manipulate it.

➡️ location.state: Used to pass info across pages
➡️ location.hash: used to navigate user on the current page
➡️ location.search: used to get query parameters eg: ?name=Priya&age=22

➡️ If you just add up the three you'll get the URL the user sees in the browser:
location.pathname + location.search + location.hash; Eg: /bbq/pig-pickins?campaign=instagram#menu

(3) How do you make sure header and footer stays consistently on each page?

We can use <Outlet/> that renders element if it matches path of the location..
Eg:
import {Outlet} from 'react-router-dom'
export default function Header(){
    return (
        <>
            <h1>This is header page</h1>
            <Outlet/>
        </>
    )
}
